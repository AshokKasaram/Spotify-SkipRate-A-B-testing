# Skip Rate Experiment — Algorithmic Playlist Quality (A/B Test)

**Goal:** Reduce early **skip rate** in algorithmic playlists by switching from a popularity-based recommender (A) to a collaborative-filtering variant (B).

## Quick Start
1. Open `Spotify_SkipRate_AB_Test.ipynb` and run all cells.
2. Tweak the CONFIG section to explore different effect sizes or sample sizes.
3. Check `RESULTS.md` for a concise readout and `sessions_simulated.csv` for the simulated dataset.

## Metrics
- **Primary:** Skip rate (≤ 30s skip proxy) — lower is better
- **Secondary:** Save rate (higher is better), Session minutes (higher is better)

## Decision Template
If skip rate decreases and saves/session minutes increase with statistical significance,  
recommend a **staged ramp (10–25%)** with guardrails (complaints, churn proxies) and cohort monitoring (device/time-of-day).
